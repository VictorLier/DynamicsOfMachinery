\section{Introduction}
The dynamics of a shaft in three systems is considered:
\begin{itemize}
    \item (I) Only shaft
    \item (II) Shaft and \SI{100}{\milli \meter} disc
    \item (III) Shaft, \SI{100}{\milli \meter} and \SI{80}{\milli \meter} discs
\end{itemize}
Both the unsupport shaft and the shaft supported by ball bearing and hydrodynamic bearing are considered. The dimensions of the shaft and discs is given in \cite[Appendix]{Problem}.
The shaft and both discs is made in ST60 steel with mechanical properties shown in table \ref{tab:mech_prop}.
\begin{table}[htbp]

    \begin{tabular}{@{}cc@{}}
        \toprule

    \end{tabular}
\end{table}



\section{Lateral Dynamics of Flexible Shaft}
The first step is creating a model of the shaft. The model is compared to a experimental result and adjusted accordingly.

\subsection{Modelling}
From the technical drawings in \cite[Appendix]{Problem} the shaft can be modelled and analyzed.

\subsubsection{Mechanical model}
The mechanical model have a simplified geometry compared to the technical drawings. The keyways at the ends of the shafts are neglected and the small fillets are not included. Other features like the screw holes, threads and the two small flanges on the shaft is likewise neglected.
The smaller steps in diamter, mostly at the ends of the shaft, is simplified to a single diameter calculated to result in the same moment of inertia as the original geometry.
The final geometry consist of 6 sections with varying diameter and length. The geometry is shown in figure \ref{fig:shaft_geometry}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \input{02/1/shaft_geometry.tex}
    \caption{Geometry of Shaft}
    \label{fig:shaft_geometry}
\end{figure}

\textcolor{blue}{D80} and \textcolor{blue}{D100} indicates the mounting point of the discs. \textcolor{red}{B1} and \textcolor{red}{B2} indicates the mounting point of the bearings.
The length and diameter of the shaft is shown in table \ref{tab:shaft_geometry}.
\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Dimensions from figure \ref{fig:shaft_geometry}}
    \label{tab:shaft_geometry}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}ccccccc@{}}
        \toprule
        $i$  &   1   &   2   &   3   &   4   &   5   &   6   \\ \midrule
        $D_i$ [\si{\milli \meter}]  &   59.5  &   70  &   89.7  &   99.7  &   89.7  &   56.45  \\
        $L_i$ [\si{\milli \meter}]  &   65 &   175    &   55 &   120  &   625  &   110    \\ \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Besides the geometric simplifications other assumptions are also made:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The shaft is assumed to be perfectly balanced.
    \item The shaft is assumed to be made of a homogenous material.
    \item The shaft is assumed axisymmetric.
    \item Each shaft element is assumed to bend with a 2nd order polynomial ie. 4 degrees of freedom at each node.
    \item The shaft bending is assumed linear and can be modelled with simple beam theory.
    \item The required bending force can be modelled as a perfect spring, ie. no loss of energy (no damping).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Mathematical model}
3 mathematical models are discretized from the mechanical model with increasing number of elements. The coarse model (seen in figure \ref{fig:coarse_model}) is seen a as a shaft with constant diameter of \SI{90}{\milli \meter} and length of \SI{1150}{\milli \meter}. The coarse model is discretized into 18 equal length elements.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \input{02/1/coarse_model.tex}
    \caption{Coarse Model}
    \label{fig:coarse_model}
\end{figure}

The fine model (figure \ref{fig:fine_model}) have more complex geometry. Here the shaft is broken up into 6 section with varying diameter and length, each with one element. This includes more of the intrecasiess of the orginal geometry. The diamters are round giving a slightly different diamter at the ends.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \input{02/1/fine_model.tex}
    \caption{Fine Model}
    \label{fig:fine_model}
\end{figure}

The very fine model (figure \ref{fig:very_fine_model}) have the same 6 sections as the mechanical geometry (figure \ref{fig:shaft_geometry}) discretizes into approximatly equally sized elements. The very fine mesh consist of 19 elements in total.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \input{02/1/very_fine_model.tex}
    \caption{Very Fine Model}
    \label{fig:very_fine_model}
\end{figure}

For each of the discretized models, the mathematical model is created the same way:

The goverining equation for the system can be written as:
\begin{equation}
    M \ddot{q} - \Omega G \dot{q} + K q = Q
\end{equation}
Where $M$ is the mass matrix, $G$ is the gyroscopic matrix, $\Omega$ is the rotational speed, $K$ is the stiffness matrix, $q$ is the displacement vector and $Q$ is the force vector. The mass matrix for each element can be found by taking the linear motion into account ( $\mathbf{M_t^e}$) and the angular motion ($\mathbf{M_R^e}$):

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{M^e} = \mathbf{M_t^e} + \mathbf{M_R^e} 
\end{equation}

For each element this matrices can be found:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{M_t^e} = \int_{0}^{l} \mu \Psi^T \Psi ds
    \label{eq:mass_matrix_linear}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{M_R^e} = \int_{0}^{l} I_d \Theta^T \Theta ds
    \label{eq:mass_matrix_angular}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{K_B^e} = \int_{0}^{l} E I \Psi''^T \Psi'' ds
\end{equation}
Where:
\begin{equation}
    \Psi(s) =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \psi_1(s) & 0 & 0 & \psi_2(s) & \psi_3(s) & 0 & 0 & \psi_4(s) \\
        0 & \psi_1(s) & -\psi_2(s) & 0 & 0 & \psi_3(s) & -\psi_4(s) & 0
    \end{bmatrix}
    \label{eq:psi}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \Theta(s) = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & -\theta_1(s) & \theta_2(s) & 0 & 0 & -\theta_3(s) & \theta_4(s) & 0 \\
        \theta_1(s) & 0 & 0 & \theta_2(s) & \theta_3(s) & 0 & 0 & \theta_4(s)
    \end{bmatrix}
    \label{eq:theta}
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{eq:psi} and \ref{eq:theta} are the shape functions for the linear and angular motion.

The elements are then assembled into each global matrix describing the enitre system.

\subsubsection{Undamped natural frequencies}
The eigenvalues of the global stiffness and mass matrix is found to find the natural frequencies of the system. The 4 lowest natural frequencies is found for each of the three models.

To make the system solveable a very small bearing stiffnes of \SI{0.01}{\pascal} is added.

\subsubsection{Convergence}
To compare the three mathematical models, a convergence study is done. Here the 4 lowest (non rigid body) natural frequencies are compared.
The resulting natural frequencies are shown in table \ref{tab:natural_freq}.
\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Undamped Natural Frequencies of Shaft}
    \label{tab:natural_freq}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}cccc@{}}
        \toprule
        Mode    &   Coarse Model (\si{\hertz})    &   Fine Model (\si{\hertz})  &   Very Fine Model (\si{\hertz}) \\ \midrule
        1       &   303.9   &   392.9   &   371.4   \\
        2       &   828.5   &   1066.2  &   916     \\
        3       &   1601.5  &   1786.4  &   1612.2  \\
        4       &   2602.7  &   3660.2  &   2550.7  \\ \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Validation}
The experimental results from \cite[6]{Problem} is compared to the mathematical model. The experimantal natural frequencies and the discrepancy between the 3 mathematical models and the experimental results is shown in table \ref{tab:validation}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \begin{adjustwidth}{-2cm}{-2cm}
    \centering
    \caption{Validation of Mathematical Model}
    \label{tab:validation}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}ccccc@{}}
        \toprule
        Mode    &   Experimental (\si{\hertz})    &   Coarse Model (\si{\percent})    &   Fine Model (\si{\percent})  &   Very Fine Model (\si{\percent}) \\ \midrule
        1       &   388     &   21.7   &   -1.3   &   4.3   \\
        2       &   930     &   10.9   &   -14.7  &   1.5     \\
        3       &   1689    &   5.2  &   -5.8  &   4.6  \\
        4       &   2624    &   0.8  &   -39.5  &   2.8  \\ \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \end{adjustwidth}
\end{table}


\subsection{Model adjustment}
As the very fine model is within \SI{5}{\percent} of the experimental results, this model is deemed accurate enough for further analysis. This model is choosen for further analysis and is refered to as system (I)

\section{Lateral Dynamics of Flexible Shaft and Discs}
The next step is to add the discs to the shaft. The same procedure as before is done. First the \SI{80}{\milli \meter} disc is added and then the \SI{100}{\milli \meter} disc is added.

\subsection{Modelling}
As before the discs are drawn in solidworks to calculate the mass and moment of inertia. The resuting geometry is perfectly balanced with the mass and moment of inertia shown in table \ref{tab:disc_mass_moment}.

\subsubsection{Mechanical model}
\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Mass and Moment of Inertia of Discs}
    \label{tab:disc_mass_moment}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}ccc@{}}
        \toprule
        Disc diamter    &   Mass                    &   Moment of Inertia                       \\ \midrule
        \SI{80}{\milli \meter}\SI{0.5}{\kilo \gram}   &   \SI{0.0001}{\kilo \gram \square \meter} \\ 
        \SI{100}{\milli \meter} &   \SI{0.4}{\kilo \gram}   &   \SI{0.001}{\kilo \gram \square \meter}\\ \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The discs are assumed to be perfectly balanced. The internal details of the discs are neglected.
The model is assumed rigid with only rigid body motion. 

\subsubsection{Mathematical model - one disc}
The mass and moment of inertia of the \SI{100}{\milli \meter} disc is added to the mathematical model of the shaft, in the node corresponding to the placement seen in \cite[Appendix]{Problem}.
As the disc is assumed to be rigid the extra stifness of the disc is not added.

The natural frequencies of the system is calculated and shown in table \ref{tab:natural_freq_one_disc}.
\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Undamped Natural Frequencies of Shaft and One Disc}
    \label{tab:natural_freq_one_disc}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}cc@{}}
        \toprule
        Mode    &   Natural Frequency (\si{\hertz})    \\ \midrule
        1       &   288.8   \\
        2       &   596.5   \\
        3       &   1243.5  \\
        4       &   1852.1  \\ 
        5       &   2.283.5 \\ \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}


This model is refered to as system (II)

\subsubsectionmark{Mathematical model - two discs}
The mass and moment of inertia of the \SI{100}{\milli \meter} disc is added to the mathematical system (II) in the node corresponding to the placement seen in \cite[Appendix]{Problem}.
The disc is assumed to be rigid and the extra stifness of the disc is not added.

The natural frequencies of the system is calculated and shown in table \ref{tab:natural_freq_two_discs}.
\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Undamped Natural Frequencies of Shaft and Two Discs}
    \label{tab:natural_freq_two_discs}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}cc@{}}
        \toprule
        Mode    &   Natural Frequency (\si{\hertz})    \\ \midrule
        1       &   242.5   \\
        2       &   502.4   \\
        3       &   929.8  \\
        4       &   1262.9  \\ 
        5       &   2276.9 \\ \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

This model is refered to as system (III)

\subsection{Validation}
With the natural frequencies of the systems (II) and (III) the experimental results from \cite[6]{Problem} is compared. The experimantal natural frequencies and the discrepancy between the mathematical models and the experimental results is shown in table \ref{tab:validation_two_discs}.
\begin{table}[htbp]
    \begin{adjustwidth}{-1cm}{-1cm}
    \centering
    \caption{Validation of Mathematical Model}
    \label{tab:validation_two_discs}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}ccccc@{}}
        \toprule
        Mode    &   Experimental (\si{\hertz})    &   System (II) (\si{\percent})    &   System (III) (\si{\percent})  \\ \midrule
        1       &   241     &   4       &   -0.6    \\
        2       &   498     &   10.8    &   -0.9    \\
        3       &   708     &   7.8     &   -31.3   \\
        4       &   1250    &   7.2     &   -1      \\ 
        5       &   2350    &   4.2     &   3       \\ \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \end{adjustwidth}
\end{table}

A major discrepancy is seen in the third mode of system (III). This is due to an interaction between the two discs. The model is adjusted to account for this.

\subsection{Model adjustment}
As only one natural frequency is significantly off, both models is deemed accurate enough for further analysis.

\section{Modelling of Ball Bearing}
When including the ball bearings at the specified points on the shaft, system (I) is considered with the ball bearing stifness going from \SIrange{e1}{10e9}{\pascal}.
The 8 first natural frequencies compared with the stifnees can be seen on figure \ref{fig:ball_bearing_stiffness}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \input{04/OPG4a.tex}
    \caption{The 8 lowest natural frequencies compared to ball bearing stiffness}
    \label{fig:ball_bearing_stiffness}
\end{figure}

As expected, the lowest eigenfrequencies, at the lowest stiffness, can be considered rigid body movements with a very low natural frequency.
With increasing stiffness the natural frequencies turns into the expected natural frequencies seen in xxxxxxxxxxxx -------- xxxxxxxxxxx indæst billeder.

\subsection{Prediction of critical speeds}
Another important aspect of the shaft system is the critical speeds. The critical speed is the speed at which the exitaction frequency is the same as the natural frequency.

\subsubsection{Campbell diagram}
The campbell diagram of system (I), (II) and (III) is shown in figure \ref{fig:campbell_diagram}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \input{04/1/OPG4.1A.tex}
    \caption{Campbell diagram of system (I), (II) and (III)}
    \label{fig:campbell_diagram}
\end{figure}

Only the upper line - Forward


\subsubsection{First mode shapes}
The first mode shape of system (I), (II) and (III) is shown in figure \ref{fig:first_mode_shape}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \input{04/1/OPG4.1B.tex}
    \caption{First mode shape of system (I), (II) and (III)}
    \label{fig:first_mode_shape}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Unbalance response \label{sec:unbalance_response_ball_bearing}}
The unbalance can be found an plotted in figure \ref{fig:unbalance_response}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{04/2/image.png}
    \caption{Unbalance response of system (I), (II) and (III)}
    \label{fig:unbalance_response}
\end{figure}

From figure \ref{fig:unbalance_response} it looks like the response is below the maximum. However, as there is no damping in the system,
the response will increase to infinity at the critical speed. As such, the maximum displacement is a function of how many steps, or how precise this infinity can be calculated.
Therefore it's not possible to determine wheter the response is below the maximum, as the maximum is always infinity even at very low unbalance.

\section{Modelling of Hydrodynamic Bearing}
Instead of using ball bearings, the use of hydrodynamic bearings is considered. One of the ball bearings in system (III) is replaced with a two-axial-groove bearing.

\subsection{Hydrodynamic bearing - Properties}
First the properties of the specific hydrodynamic bearing is found.

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
The fluid inside the hydrodynamic bearing is assumed to be incompressible and the flow is assumed to be laminar. The bearing is assumed to be perfectly balanced.


\subsubsection{External static load}
To calculate the external static load a free body diagram is made. The free body diagram is shown in figure \ref{fig:free_body_diagram}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \input{05/1/5.1.2.tex}
    \caption{Free body diagram of hydrodynamic bearing}
    \label{fig:free_body_diagram}
\end{figure}

With the geometry given the length can be found in table \ref{tab:hydrodynamic_bearing_properties}.
\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Properties of Hydrodynamic Bearing}
    \label{tab:hydrodynamic_bearing_properties}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}ccccc@{}}
        \toprule
        $L_{D1}$    &   $L_{D2}$    &   $L_S$   &   $L_{R1}$   &   $L_{R2}$   \\ \midrule
        \SI{0.123}{\meter}  &   \SI{0.182}{\meter}  &   \SI{0.575}{\meter}   &   \SI{0.355}{\meter}   &   \SI{1.095}{\meter}   \\ \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The forces are found form the greavitational force and there respective weight. The forces are shown in table \ref{tab:hydrodynamic_bearing_forces}.
\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Forces in Hydrodynamic Bearing}
    \label{tab:hydrodynamic_bearing_forces}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}ccc@{}}
        \toprule
        $F_{D1}$    &   $F_{D2}$    &   $F_S$   \\ \midrule
        \SI{347.6}{\newton}  &   \SI{445.0}{\newton}  &   \SI{206.2}{\newton}   \\ \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Force equilibirum can then be used to find the reaction forces:
\begin{equation}
    R_1 + R_2 - F_{D1} - F_{D2} - F_S = 0
    \label{eq:vertical_equilibrium}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    -F_{D1} L_{D1} - F_{D2} L_{D2} - F_S L_S + R_1 L_{R1} + R_2 L_{R2} = 0
    \label{eq:moment_equilibrium}
\end{equation}
Solving equation \ref{eq:vertical_equilibrium} and \ref{eq:moment_equilibrium} for $R_1$ and $R_2$ gives the reaction forces shown in table \ref{tab:hydrodynamic_bearing_reactions}.
\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Reaction Forces in Hydrodynamic Bearing}
    \label{tab:hydrodynamic_bearing_reactions}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}cc@{}}
        \toprule
        $R_1$    &   $R_2$    \\ \midrule
        \SI{1150.7}{\newton}  &   \SI{-151.9}{\newton}  \\ \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Oil film thickness}
The oil fim thickness can be found and shown in figure \ref{fig:oil_film_thickness}.

    \centering
    \input{05/1/5.1.3.tex}
    \caption{Oil film thickness in Hydrodynamic Bearing}
    \label{fig:oil_film_thickness}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Stiffnes and damping}
The stiffness and damping of the hydrodynamic bearing is found. The stiffness compared to the angular velocity is shown in figure \ref{fig:hydrodynamic_bearing_stiffness}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \input{05/1/5.1.4K.tex}
    \caption{Stiffness of Hydrodynamic Bearing}

The damping compared to the angular velocity is shown in figure \ref{fig:hydrodynamic_bearing_damping}.

    \input{05/1/5.1.4B.tex}
    \caption{Damping of Hydrodynamic Bearing}
    \label{fig:hydrodynamic_bearing_damping}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Prediction of Critical Speed}
To predict the two first critical speeds a campbell diagram is used.

\subsubsection{First two critical speeds}
The campbell diagram is shown in figure \ref{fig:hydrodynamic_bearing_campbell}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \input{05/2/5.2.1.tex}
    \caption{Campbell diagram of Hydrodynamic Bearing}
    \label{fig:hydrodynamic_bearing_campbell}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Operational range}
The operation range can be determined from figure \ref{fig:hydrodynamic_bearing_campbell} to be xxxxxxxxxxx

\subsection{Rotor Bearing Stability Limit}
instability occurs when the real part of the eigenvalues are positive. 

\subsubsection{Maximum angular velocity}
To check for instability, the real parts of the eigenvalues are plotted in figure \ref{fig:hydrodynamic_bearing_eigenvalues}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \input{05/3/5.3.1.tex}
    \caption{Real parts of eigenvalues of Hydrodynamic Bearing}
    \label{fig:hydrodynamic_bearing_eigenvalues}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Frequency of unstable vibration}
57.8704

\subsubsection{Ratio between unstable Frequency and angular velocity}
0.6156

\subsection{Unbalance response}
Unlike with a ball bearing (see section \ref{sec:unbalance_response_ball_bearing}), the unbalance response of a hydrodynamic bearing is not infinite at the critical speed.
As there is damping in the system, the response will not increase to infinity at the critical speed. The maximum displacement can be found and is shown in figure \ref{fig:hydrodynamic_bearing_unbalance_response}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \input{05/4/5.4.tex}
    \caption{Unbalance response of Hydrodynamic Bearing}
    \label{fig:hydrodynamic_bearing_unbalance_response}
\end{figure}

From figure \ref{fig:hydrodynamic_bearing_unbalance_response} it can be seen that the response is below the maximum allowed displacement with a unbalance of \SI{1000}{\gram \milli \meter}.

\subsection{Engeineering application}
It's possible to extend the maximum angular velocity of the system by changing the charictaristics of the hydrodynamic bearing.

\subsubsection{Extend maximum angular velocity}
One could be to change the oil type used. Changing it to ISO-10 yields the stability map seen in figure \ref{fig:hydrodynamic_bearing_stability_map}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \input{05/5/5.5.tex}
    \caption{Stability map of Hydrodynamic Bearing}
    \label{fig:hydrodynamic_bearing_stability_map}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Procentile improvement}
The Procentile improvement can be seen in table xxxxx
